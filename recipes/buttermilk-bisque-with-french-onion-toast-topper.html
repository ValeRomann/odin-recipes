    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (2 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne peppe</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until onion is tender but not browned, about 10 minutes.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Increase heat to medium-high. Stir in tomato paste. Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture begins to caramelize and brown, about 2 minutes. Add squash, chicken broth, remaining kosher salt, and cayenne pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until squash is very tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Reduce heat to low.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Using an immersion blender, blend squash mixture until smooth. (Or transfer mixture, in batches if needed, to a blender or food processor. Cover and blend or process until smooth. Return to pot.) Stir in cream and maple syrup.           
        </li>
        <li>
            Ladle soup into wide shallow bowls. Serve with French Onion Toast Toppers and top with parsley.          
        </li>
    </ol>
